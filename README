= SEO Help

SEO Help provides some extra tags for the display of page meta content.

  <r:if_meta name="description" inherit="false">...</r:if_meta>
  <r:unless_meta name="description" inherit="false">...</r:unless_meta>

Details are provided in the tag descriptions.

You should consider using page parts for your page meta data. The tags involved in
using pages parts are significantly more helpful and flexible than the tags to
support the meta information.

With <r:if_content>, <r:unless_content> and <r:content> you can do significantly
more than what this extension provides.
